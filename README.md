Project Description: 

Plan For Mi aims to simplify the event planning process by serving as a comprehensive platform connecting event planners with a diverse array of
local vendors. Our project will involve developing a robust backend API to support the platform's functionalities, including vendor management,
event planning tools, and customer-vendor interactions. The API will facilitate seamless read and write operations with a relational database, 
ensuring persistent data storage of vendor details, event bookings, customer reviews, and more. This public API will not only act as the 
backbone for the Plan For Mi platform but also potentially enable integration with other platforms or services in the future, amplifying its 
utility in the event planning ecosystem.
